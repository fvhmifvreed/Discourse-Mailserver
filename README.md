### **Steps to Merge 4 Helm Charts into 1 Chart**

#### **Step 1: Create a New Parent Chart**
1. **Create a new Helm chart** that will serve as the parent chart:
   ```bash
   helm create merged-chart
   ```
2. This will create a directory named `merged-chart` with the basic Helm chart structure.

#### **Step 2: Organize Sub-Charts as Dependencies**
1. In the `merged-chart` directory, open the `Chart.yaml` file.
2. Add the four existing charts as dependencies. Here’s an example:

   **`Chart.yaml`**:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v2
   name: merged-chart
   description: A merged Helm chart that combines 4 charts
   version: 0.1.0

   dependencies:
     - name: chart1
       version: 1.0.0
       repository: "file://../path-to-chart1"
     - name: chart2
       version: 1.0.0
       repository: "file://../path-to-chart2"
     - name: chart3
       version: 1.0.0
       repository: "file://../path-to-chart3"
     - name: chart4
       version: 1.0.0
       repository: "file://../path-to-chart4"
   ```
   - **`repository: "file://../path-to-chart"`** refers to the local path of the chart. Adjust this path to point to your existing chart directories.
   - You can also use remote repositories (e.g., for charts hosted on a ChartMuseum or other Helm repositories).

#### **Step 3: Update Dependencies**
Run the following command to update the dependencies and pull in the sub-charts:
```bash
helm dependency update merged-chart
```
- This will download the dependencies into the `charts/` directory inside `merged-chart`.

#### **Step 4: Customize Values for Sub-Charts**
1. Open the **`values.yaml`** file in the `merged-chart` directory.
2. Define configurations for each sub-chart:

   **`values.yaml`**:
   ```yaml
   chart1:
     replicaCount: 2
     service:
       type: ClusterIP
       port: 80

   chart2:
     replicaCount: 1
     service:
       type: NodePort
       port: 30001

   chart3:
     image:
       repository: nginx
       tag: latest

   chart4:
     persistence:
       enabled: true
       size: 10Gi
   ```
   - These configurations will override the default values in each of the sub-charts.
   - Adjust values according to the parameters supported by the original charts.

#### **Step 5: Install the Merged Chart**
Now that the parent chart includes all the dependencies, you can install it:

```bash
helm install merged-release merged-chart/
```

This command will deploy all four sub-charts together as part of a single release.

### **Benefits of Using a Single Parent Chart**
- **Unified Deployment**: Deploy, upgrade, or rollback all components at once.
- **Centralized Configuration**: Manage values for each sub-chart from a single `values.yaml`.
- **Dependency Management**: Automatically manage and version dependencies.

### **Example Directory Structure**
Here’s what the merged chart directory might look like:

```
merged-chart/
  ├── charts/
  │   ├── chart1-1.0.0.tgz
  │   ├── chart2-1.0.0.tgz
  │   ├── chart3-1.0.0.tgz
  │   └── chart4-1.0.0.tgz
  ├── templates/
  ├── Chart.yaml
  ├── values.yaml
  └── ...
```

### **Troubleshooting Tips**
- **Ensure version compatibility**: Make sure the sub-charts' versions are compatible with Helm v3.
- **Adjust sub-chart paths correctly**: Ensure that the `file://` paths in `Chart.yaml` are accurate.
- **Customize templates if needed**: If there are conflicts in the templates of the sub-charts, you may need to modify them to ensure they work together.

  ### **1. Set Up the Parent Chart Directory**
Let’s assume you have 4 Helm chart directories: **`chart1/`**, **`chart2/`**, **`chart3/`**, and **`chart4/`** in your working directory, and you want to merge them into a new parent chart.

#### **Create the Parent Chart**
1. Create a new Helm chart:
   ```bash
   helm create merged-chart
   ```
2. Go to the `merged-chart` directory:
   ```bash
   cd merged-chart
   ```

### **2. Add Local Paths for Dependencies in `Chart.yaml`**
Update the **`Chart.yaml`** file in the `merged-chart` directory to include dependencies using the **file path** of each local Helm chart:

```yaml
apiVersion: v2
name: merged-chart
description: A merged Helm chart combining multiple charts
version: 0.1.0

dependencies:
  - name: chart1
    version: 1.0.0
    repository: "file://../chart1"
  - name: chart2
    version: 1.0.0
    repository: "file://../chart2"
  - name: chart3
    version: 1.0.0
    repository: "file://../chart3"
  - name: chart4
    version: 1.0.0
    repository: "file://../chart4"
```

### **3. Update Dependencies**
After defining the dependencies, update the Helm chart dependencies:

```bash
helm dependency update
```

- This command will resolve the dependencies and copy the local charts into the `merged-chart/charts/` directory.

### **4. Customize the `values.yaml` for Merged Chart**
Edit the **`values.yaml`** file in the `merged-chart` directory to include configurations for each sub-chart:

```yaml
chart1:
  replicaCount: 2
  service:
    type: ClusterIP
    port: 80

chart2:
  replicaCount: 1
  service:
    type: NodePort
    port: 30001

chart3:
  image:
    repository: nginx
    tag: latest

chart4:
  persistence:
    enabled: true
    size: 10Gi
```

### **5. Install the Merged Chart**
Now you can install the parent chart, which includes the sub-charts:

```bash
helm install merged-release ./merged-chart
```

### **Folder Structure Example**
Assuming your directory structure looks like this:

```
.
├── chart1/
│   └── ...
├── chart2/
│   └── ...
├── chart3/
│   └── ...
├── chart4/
│   └── ...
└── merged-chart/
    ├── charts/
    ├── templates/
    ├── Chart.yaml
    ├── values.yaml
    └── ...
```

### **Key Considerations**
- Ensure that each sub-chart has a **`Chart.yaml`** with the correct **`version`** and **`name`** fields.
- Ensure that the **file paths** in the `dependencies` section of the parent chart are correct relative paths.
- The Helm **`dependency update`** command copies the local charts into the parent chart’s `charts/` directory, making them part of the combined chart.

This approach will merge the 4 charts into a single parent Helm chart that can be managed as a single release. Let me know if you encounter any issues or have questions!
